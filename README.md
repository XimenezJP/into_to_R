# Introduction to R

These materials are intended to provide basic R programming for the Bioinformatics Workshop on Virus Evolution and Molecular Epidemiology (VEME 2021), September 5 - September 10, 2021.

## About the materials
This is one day hands on workshop designed for people who are brand new to R & RStudio and who learn best in person. You will learn the basics of R and data science, and practice using the RStudio IDE (integrated development environment). We will have a team of TAs on hand to show you the ropes, and help you out when you get stuck.

These materials were based on Introduction to R (2014), and https://github.com/rstudio/master-the-tidyverse (2017). They are intended to be appropriate for people who have never used R before.
